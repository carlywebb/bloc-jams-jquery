# bloc-jams-jquery
A starter project for Bloc's jQuery-driven music player app
This app was a project on Javascript and JQuery, where I utlized those languages to have the player respond to play/pause, skip, 
previous, total time and percentage of total time. The project was led by myself, with my mentor's assistance.
